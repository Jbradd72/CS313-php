                    Brief Bio:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> My name is Jeff Bradley. I was born and raised in Northern California. I spent two years in Northern England as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was married at the Oakland Temple about a year ago and now my wife is pregnant with twins! I am studying Computer Science at BYU-Idaho. This is the beginning of my third year here at BYUI, though I am technically a senior. I love working with computers and technology of all sorts and am excited to learn more about Backend Web Engineering!</b>
