                Brief Bio:
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b> My name is Jeff Bradley. I was born and raised in Northern California. I spent two years in Northern England as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was married at the Oakland Temple about a year ago and now my wife is pregnant with twins! I am studying Computer Science at BYU-Idaho. This is the beginning of my third year here at BYUI, though I am technically a senior. I love working with computers and technology of all sorts and am excited to learn more about Backend Web Engineering!</b>

                My Favourite Poem:
            </h3>
            <blockquote>
                Out of the night that covers me, <br/>Black as the pit from pole to pole<br/> I thank whatever gods may be <br/> For my unconquerable soul<br/><br/> In the fell clutch of circumstance <br/> I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br/> Under the bludgeonings of chance <br/> My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br/><br/> Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br/> Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br/> And yet the menace of the years <br/> Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br/><br/> It matters not how strait the gate, <br/> How charged with punishments the scroll, <br/> I am the master of my fate. <br/> I am the captain of my soul.
                <br/><br/> <b>-William Earnest Henley</b>
